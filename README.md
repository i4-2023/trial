This is NOT the repository we're building our website on. This is just a sample thing for the time being. We'll use this to familiarize ourselves with Git commands, pull requests, adding, pulling, push, merge and all that kinda fancy stuff.

This repository will be used to create the mock website, and if all is well, we can copy the contents into the main 2023 folder.
