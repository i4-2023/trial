This is NOT the repository we're building our website on. This is just a sample thing for the time being. We'll use this to familiarize ourselves with Git commands, pull requests, adding, pulling, push, merge and all that kinda fancy stuff. 

This repo is NOT hosted on Git pages yet, so to see changes, we can simply just click on "view on Live Server" through our code editor. Ez peazy.
